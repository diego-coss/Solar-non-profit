      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

          <h1>It makes a difference</h1>
          <p>Switching to solar energy makes a significant difference by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, which are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Solar power is a clean, renewable energy source that harnesses the sun's energy to generate electricity without emitting harmful pollutants. This transition helps mitigate climate change, reduces our carbon footprint, and promotes sustainable living. Additionally, solar energy can provide long-term cost savings and energy independence for individuals and communities, while also creating green jobs and fostering innovation in renewable technologies. By adopting solar power, we contribute to a healthier planet and a more resilient future for all.</p>
